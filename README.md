Nice rename‚Äî**`qnds`** has a sharp, professional feel üëå (Quick Network Diagnostic Scripts, I‚Äôm guessing?).

Since GitHub READMEs use Markdown, you can‚Äôt do exact "CSS-style" margins or padding, but we can:

- Use `>` blockquotes to add **visual separation**
- Use **code blocks** with titles (via `bash`, `powershell`, etc.) to draw attention
- Add **headers + icons** for quick scanning
- Use consistent spacing and horizontal rules to break up sections

Here‚Äôs a polished version of your README section with better structure and focus:

---

Let me know if you want this section at the top, split into subpages, or styled differently for your preferred Markdown viewer. Happy to help design the whole README if you're doing a polish pass!
